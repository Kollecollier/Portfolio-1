- ### Media Section
  - In this section i have provided a h3 were i indicate who we are. And the media section is a part of the page were the audiance can navigate down through some video content.

   - I have added external links to the media section were you can select 3 of the bands videos to view. 
    - This is also adjusted so the selected video play's on the page and dosn't send you to an external page.

- ### Contact / Get in touch section
  - In this section of the page, i have provided a contact form for any user that wishe's to make contact to the artist in anyway.

   - The form is big and clear. The ide for the wide radius of the contact form is suppost to have the function to make it easy to find and easy to apply any info or inputs to the fields.
